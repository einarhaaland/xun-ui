# xun-ui

For now, ignore files [app.js, svg.js, canvas.js]

app.js was a file to play around with D3 and should not be part of future work.

svg.js was incase html elements would not work and the project should reverse to using svg.
(svg.js is outdated).

canvas.js was incase svg for paths would not work and the project should reverse to using multiple canvas.
(canvas.js is outdated)

## Graph based UI generated entirely by data using D3.js
